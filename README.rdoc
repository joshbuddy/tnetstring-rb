== tnetstring-rb

Typed netstrings were conceived by Zed Shaw as a convenient text format for
exchanging small amounts of data over the network. They are meant as an
alternative to JSON that are easier to handle in low-level network code.
See his initial implementation here:
{typed netstrings in Python}[http://codepad.org/xct0E5ac].
